To resolve the issue, the utility company dispatched a repair crew to the substation and replaced the faulty transformer. Once the new transformer was installed and tested, power was restored to Acme Corp's main office building.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

Develop a plan to upgrade and modernize the electrical system, including the installation of backup generators or alternative power sources.

2. **Implement Backup Power Solutions**: Invest in a reliable backup power system, such as standby generators or battery storage, to ensure that critical business operations can continue in the event of a power outage.

3. **Review and Update Incident Response Plans**: Review and update the company's incident response plans to ensure they are comprehensive and effective. This should include clear communication protocols, roles and responsibilities, and procedures for quickly mobilizing resources during a power outage or other emergency.

4. **Enhance Employee Preparedness**: Provide training and resources to employees on how to respond to power outages and other emergency situations. This could include guidelines for remote work, data backup procedures, and emergency contact information.

5. **Collaborate with Utility Provider**: Establish a stronger working relationship with the local utility provider, including regular communication and coordination to stay informed about potential issues or planned maintenance that could affect Acme Corp's power supply.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, Acme Corp can improve its resilience, reduce the impact of future power outages, and ensure the continuity of its business operations.
